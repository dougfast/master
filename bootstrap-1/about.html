        <h3>A little about me...</h3>
		 <div>
			<p>
			I'm a Colorado native who grew up in the Denver metro area. I enjoy cycling, archery and figuring out ways to get things done. As a technical person I have a need to understand how things work and how they intereact with each other. As a creative person I enjoy creating something new from bits and pieces of other things. There is nothing more satisfying than taking a piece of well crafted writing and coupling it with relevant, inspring imagery to create a compelling story. I have a diverse background and skill set that allows me to understand what your requirments are and what needs to be done to satisfy your needs and wants.</p>
		 </div>		
<h3>The early years</h3>
	<div>
		<p>I began my career working on residential construction sites for my step father. At the time it was a dream job taking something from an idea to an actual home for a family. In the process I learned how buildings go together, how critical scheduling is and how to manage customer expectations.</p>
	</div>
<h3>Food Service</h3>
	<div>
		<p>With interest rates at an all time high and difficulty in finding good work in construction, I had an opportunity to wait tables, bartend and manage a restuarant. Although I often argue that restaurants are actually manufacturing facilities, it taught me how raw materials can be assembled to create a finished product. In fact, I often think of my current industry, building insulation, as being analgous to a Mexican food restuarant; the same ingredients can be arranged in different ways and proportions to make a new product. This can also be applied to web development. With access to different types of content and web development tools, a wide varienty of messages can be created.</p>
	</div>
<h3>Engineering - Research and Development</h3>
	<div>
		<p> As fun and interesting as food service was, it was really just something to pay the bills while I was getting my engineering degree. Food service is a young person's business and it takes its toll on the body and the mind after awhile. Don't get me wrong, it was fun while it lasted, but it wasn't a destination for me. After I graduated, I started working for an insulation manufacturer. It's a good job and the company has treated me well. No regrets with this move. I have been able to use technical things like math, science and some programming which has been interesting. The people skills I learned in food service certainly came in handy. This job also gave me insight into the business side of things. In that way, restaurants have more in common with the manufacture of insulation than one would think.</p>
	</div>
<h3>Which brings us to the present...</h3>
	<div>
		<p>As good as things are, I began to realize that I needed an outlet, and a potential career, for my creative side. As I work with our marketing team I realize that there are better ways to present technical information. Additionally, there is a big demand for web development skills and content creation. It never ceases to amaze me about what can be done with a little bit of content and some software. The possibles are as numerous as your ideas.</p>
